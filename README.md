# Intro-to-TensorFlow-for-AI

This part is based on the online course Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. The main topics are covered by EECS 598 Computational Data Science. The main focus is about computer vision (CV), e.g. the principle of convolutional neural network. One the resource about image filtering is https://lodev.org/cgtutor/filtering.html. We can also find details about CV from YouTube https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF.   
There are also many useful material, such as Understanding different loss functions https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/ and mini-batch gradient descent http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf
